# Media Comments Implementation Plan

## Overview
Add the ability for users to comment on photos and videos in the Swiss Adventure Album. Comments will be displayed in an elegant, non-intrusive way that maintains the beautiful glass aesthetic of the application.

## User Stories
- **As a user**, I want to add comments to photos/videos to share my thoughts or memories
- **As a user**, I want to see who wrote each comment and when
- **As a user**, I want to edit/delete my own comments
- **As a user**, I want to see all comments in chronological order
- **As a user**, I want comments to be visually integrated without overwhelming the media

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- New table for media comments
CREATE TABLE media_comments (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  media_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (media_id) REFERENCES event_media (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Index for efficient queries
CREATE INDEX idx_media_comments_media_id ON media_comments(media_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_media_comments_created_at ON media_comments(created_at);
```

### Type Definitions
```typescript
interface MediaComment {
  id: string;
  mediaId: string;
  userId: string;
  content: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  author: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    avatar: string;
  };
}

interface MediaItem {
  // ... existing properties
  comments?: MediaComment[];
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Backend API & Database
**Goal**: Create the foundation for comment storage and retrieval

**Tasks**:
1. **Database Migration**
   - Add `media_comments` table to schema
   - Create indexes for performance
   - Test migration on dev database

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `GET /api/media/:mediaId/comments` - Retrieve comments for media
   - `POST /api/media/:mediaId/comments` - Add new comment
   - `PUT /api/comments/:commentId` - Edit existing comment
   - `DELETE /api/comments/:commentId` - Delete comment

3. **Validation & Security**
   - Authenticate all comment operations
   - Validate comment content (max length, sanitization)
   - Ensure users can only edit/delete their own comments

**Testing**: API endpoint testing with Postman/curl

### Phase 2: Comment Data Integration
**Goal**: Load and manage comment data in the frontend

**Tasks**:
1. **API Service Updates**
   - Add comment CRUD methods to `api.ts`
   - Integrate comment loading with media loading
   - Handle comment state management

2. **Type System Updates**
   - Update MediaItem type to include comments
   - Add comment-related types to type definitions
   - Update existing components to handle comment data

3. **Data Flow**
   - Load comments when media is loaded
   - Real-time comment updates (optimistic updates)
   - Error handling for comment operations

**Testing**: Data loading and state management verification

### Phase 3: Comment UI Components
**Goal**: Create beautiful, accessible comment interface components

**Tasks**:
1. **CommentsList Component**
   ```typescript
   interface CommentsListProps {
     comments: MediaComment[];
     mediaId: string;
     currentUserId: string;
     onAddComment: (content: string) => void;
     onEditComment: (commentId: string, content: string) => void;
     onDeleteComment: (commentId: string) => void;
   }
   ```

2. **CommentItem Component**
   - Display author avatar, name, timestamp
   - Show/edit comment content
   - Edit/delete buttons for own comments
   - Glass morphism styling to match app aesthetic

3. **AddCommentForm Component**
   - Textarea for comment input
   - Character count indicator
   - Submit/cancel buttons
   - Auto-resize text area

4. **CommentButton Component**
   - Floating button to show/hide comments
   - Comment count indicator
   - Glass styling with hover effects

**Testing**: Component rendering and interaction testing

### Phase 4: Comments Integration in MediaGallery
**Goal**: Integrate comments seamlessly into the existing media display

**Tasks**:
1. **MediaGallery Updates**
   - Add comment button to each media item
   - Handle comment visibility toggle
   - Position comments overlay properly

2. **Comment Positioning Strategy**
   ```
   Option A: Overlay on media (bottom portion)
   Option B: Below media with expand/collapse
   Option C: Side panel for detailed view
   
   Recommendation: Option A for mobile, Option B for desktop
   ```

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile: Comments overlay at bottom of media
   - Desktop: Comments panel below or beside media
   - Smooth animations for show/hide

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Lazy load comments (only when requested)
   - Virtual scrolling for many comments
   - Debounced comment input

**Testing**: Integration testing with existing media display

### Phase 5: Advanced Features & Polish
**Goal**: Add enhanced features and perfect the user experience

**Tasks**:
1. **Comment Interactions**
   - @mentions support (future enhancement)
   - Rich text formatting (basic bold/italic)
   - Link detection and rendering

2. **Enhanced UX**
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to submit)
   - Comment draft saving
   - Toast notifications for comment actions

3. **Mobile Optimizations**
   - Touch-friendly comment interface
   - Swipe gestures for comment actions
   - Optimized keyboard handling

4. **Accessibility**
   - Screen reader support
   - Keyboard navigation
   - ARIA labels and roles

**Testing**: End-to-end testing, accessibility testing, mobile testing

## UI/UX Design Considerations

### Visual Design
- **Glass Morphism**: Comments use same translucent background as rest of app
- **Typography**: Consistent with existing text hierarchy
- **Colors**: Stone color palette with subtle accents
- **Spacing**: Comfortable reading with proper margins

### Comment Display Options
1. **Floating Overlay** (Recommended for mobile)
   - Appears over bottom portion of media
   - Semi-transparent background
   - Swipe up to expand fully

2. **Inline Expansion** (Recommended for desktop)
   - Comments appear below media when toggled
   - Smooth slide-down animation
   - Compact view shows comment count

3. **Side Panel** (Alternative for desktop)
   - Comments in dedicated panel
   - Better for many comments
   - Maintains media focus

### Interaction Patterns
- **Add Comment**: Click comment button → text area appears
- **Edit Comment**: Double-click or edit button → inline editing
- **Delete Comment**: Delete button → confirmation dialog
- **View Comments**: Comment count button → expand/collapse

## Performance Considerations

### Data Loading
- Load comments on-demand (when comment button clicked)
- Cache comments in memory during session
- Batch comment operations when possible

### Rendering
- Virtual scrolling for 50+ comments
- Debounced input for real-time features
- Optimistic UI updates for responsiveness

### Database
- Proper indexing on media_id and created_at
- Consider pagination for popular media
- Regular cleanup of orphaned comments

## Security & Privacy

### Authentication
- All comment operations require valid session
- Users can only modify their own comments
- Rate limiting on comment creation

### Data Validation
- Max comment length (500-1000 characters)
- XSS prevention through sanitization
- Profanity filtering (optional)

### Privacy
- Comments are visible to all album participants
- No private/direct messaging features
- Audit log for comment moderation (admin feature)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Comment CRUD operations
- Comment validation logic
- Comment display components

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint testing

2. **Phase 2**: Limited beta with core users
3. **Phase 3**: Full rollout with monitoring
4. **Phase 4**: Feature enhancements based on feedback

### Monitoring
- Comment creation/deletion metrics
- Performance monitoring (load times)
- Error tracking and alerting
- User engagement analytics

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 6+ Ideas
- **Reactions**: Like/heart reactions on comments
- **Mentions**: @username mentions with notifications
