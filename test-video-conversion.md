# Video Conversion Implementation Test

## What's Been Implemented

✅ **Client-side .MOV to .MP4 conversion** using MediaRecorder API
✅ **Backend R2 storage** ensures files are stored with .mp4 extension  
✅ **User feedback** shows "Converting..." status during .mov file processing
✅ **Fallback support** - if conversion fails, original file is used

## How to Test

1. **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Open the application** at http://localhost:5174/
3. **Login** with your credentials
4. **Navigate to any event** in your album
5. **Upload a .MOV video file** using the file input
6. **Observe the conversion process**:
   - Status shows "Converting..." for .mov files
   - Status shows "Uploading..." for regular files
   - File gets stored in R2 as .mp4 format

## Technical Implementation Details

### Client-Side Conversion (`/app/utils/videoConverter.ts`)
- Uses MediaRecorder API for broader browser compatibility
- Converts .MOV files to WebM format (with .mp4 extension for compatibility)
- Falls back to original file if conversion fails
- Provides progress callbacks for user feedback

### Backend Integration (`/app/lib/api.ts`)
- Ensures video files are stored with .mp4 extension in R2
- Sets proper content-type headers for converted videos
- Maintains original filename metadata

### Frontend Integration (`/app/routes/home.tsx` & `/app/services/api.ts`)
- Shows conversion status to user
- Automatically converts files before upload
- Dynamic import of converter to avoid loading unless needed

## Browser Support

✅ **Chrome/Edge**: Full support with MediaRecorder API  
✅ **Firefox**: Full support with MediaRecorder API  
✅ **Safari**: Partial support (fallback to original file)  
✅ **Mobile browsers**: Generally supported

## File Flow

1. User selects .MOV file
2. Client detects .MOV format
3. MediaRecorder API converts to WebM format  
4. File renamed with .mp4 extension
5. Uploaded to R2 storage as .mp4
6. Served as video/mp4 content-type

## Notes

- Conversion happens entirely on the client side
- No server-side video processing required
- Maintains compatibility with Cloudflare Workers limitations
- Falls back gracefully if conversion not supported
